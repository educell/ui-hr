                At Educell, we believe that all successful student outcomes are determined by the participation and input from all team members which includes the students themselves. By facilitating communication and gathering comprehensive data metrics and documenting progress monitoring, teams will be able to assess whether or not a student is making progress toward desired outcomes. If a student is not making progress then the team can reconvene in a formal setting and determine new approaches in an effort to reinforce the desired outcomes. Educell empowers interested parties by allowing them to have a voice and to collaborate with others.
